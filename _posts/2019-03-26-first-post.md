This is the beginning in my first series of posts in my personal page. At this time, I am the begginer, never writing before, 
don't know how to write a Jekyll post and have only the fundamental knowledge of Java language.

After being a developer for almost 2 years, I understand that building your own reputation is very important. On the road of building if, you can improve your English, your writing skill, your ability of retransmiting your idea to the other and gain a lot of specialist knowledge.

By creating blogs this series, my purpose is to learn Jekyll rule to set up my page and get knowledge about advanced Java.
I have found some links(below). Hence, in this series, all posts will present what I found interesting while learning advance Java.
